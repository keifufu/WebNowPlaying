# WebNowPlaying Redux
A fork of the [original](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying-BrowserExtension) WebNowPlaying browser extension, rebuilt from scratch to make development easier.  
Intended to work together with the [original](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) WebNowPlaying Rainmeter plugin.

### Supported websites
- Apple Music
- SoundCloud
- Spotify
- Tidal
- Twitch
- YouTube
- YouTube Music
- Any website with a video or music element might work, you can enable them in the options (Click the extension icon)

I will consider adding other websites if there is demand for it.  
Please do keep in mind that I can't easily develop for paid services,
unless they have a fully functioning demo.  
For example, Amazon Music's demo has half it's UI elements hidden, you can't skip through songs, etc.
